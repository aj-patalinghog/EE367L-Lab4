In green Manoa Valley our Alma Mater stands
The flag of freedom beckons above her shining halls,
To larger truth and service our Alma Mater calls.

Hawai`i, we have gathered within thy wide-flung doors,
As sons and daughters claiming her freely offered stores;
Till ocean's far horizons shall hear thy honored name.
